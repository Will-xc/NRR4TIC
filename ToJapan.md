🌸 Experience the Elegance of Hangzhou at the Asian Games 🌸
Dear friends in Japan,
We are delighted to extend an invitation that transcends time, culture, and borders. The Hangzhou Asian Games, a celebration of Asian unity and excellence, is just around the corner. As a dedicated member of the national external publicity department, we're excited to share the essence of this extraordinary event with you.
🌟 **The Emblem: A Bridge Across Millennia** 🌟 Behold the seal bearing the emblem of the Hangzhou Asian Games, a masterpiece that spans five millennia of Chinese civilization. Co-created by Sang Jianhua, a member of the Xiling Seal Art Society, and Shen Jianyuan, a Chinese master of arts and crafts, this jade seal bridges the gap between tradition and modernity. It tells the story of the Liangzhu Civilization, the brilliance of modern Asian Games culture, the flow of the Qiantang River tide, and the lotus of transcendence. The emblem is a fusion of 'tradition' and 'modern,' carrying the best wishes for the Hangzhou Asian Games. "Asian Games Celebration, Emblem Forever" symbolizes integrity, solemnity, and success, embodying the lofty tribute of Chinese and Asian people to the spirit and culture of the Asian Games.

🏟️ **The Big Lotus: Heart of the Games** 🏟️ Step into the Hangzhou Olympic Sports Center Stadium, affectionately known as the "Big Lotus." This iconic venue is the heartbeat of the Hangzhou Asian Games, hosting thrilling athletics events. Located in the Binjiang District of Hangzhou, it stands as a symbol of modernity and cultural fusion. Inspired by ancient silk patterns and the dynamic flow of the Qiantang River, its design is truly a work of art. The roof, composed of 28 large petals and 27 small petals, mirrors the "lotus" in full bloom by the Qiantang River. From a distance, it appears as a dynamic and elegant spectacle, inviting you to witness the magic of the Asian Games.
