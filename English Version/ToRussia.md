🏅 **"Hushan" Medals: Where Tradition Meets Excellence** 🏅 The medals for the 19th Hangzhou Asian Games are more than just symbols of victory; they are works of art that blend tradition and modernity. Named "Hushan," these medals draw inspiration from the ritual jade cong of the Liangzhu culture. Combining the square cong and the circular medal into one distinctive design, "Hushan" reflects the geographical features of Hangzhou. The front of the medal paints a picturesque scene of Hangzhou, with its cloud-covered mountains and rippling waters. It's a breathtaking sight that captures the essence of this beautiful city.
